            {
              "answer": "The New Economic Policy of 1991 was founded on liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation. For KnowledgeCompass, liberalisation, particularly the deregulation of the industrial sector and financial sector reforms, was crucial as it reduced governmental restrictions, made it easier to start and expand a private firm, and increased access to finance. Globalisation, through the emphasis on opening up the economy, facilitated access to foreign technology and investment, while also creating opportunities for outsourcing services, which an EdTech company could leverage.",

              "answer": "Globalisation led to the integration of the Indian economy with the world economy, making it a hub for outsourcing. For KnowledgeCompass, this meant they could leverage India's low wage rates and availability of skilled manpower (especially in IT and education) to provide cost-effective content creation, software development, and customer support services. By outsourcing non-core functions or even core content development to India, KnowledgeCompass could significantly reduce operational costs while maintaining quality, allowing them to offer competitive pricing globally and scale rapidly.",

              "answer": "Stabilisation measures are short-term policies aimed at correcting balance of payments weaknesses and controlling inflation, such as rupee devaluation. Structural reform measures are long-term policies designed to improve economic efficiency and international competitiveness by removing rigidities, like deregulation and privatisation. For KnowledgeCompass, a private enterprise, structural reform measures were far more beneficial. Deregulation meant reduced barriers to entry and growth, and financial sector reforms provided greater access to capital and allowed for diversified investment. While a stable macroeconomic environment (from stabilisation measures) is important, the fundamental changes brought about by structural reforms directly enabled the growth of private businesses by creating a more competitive and open operational landscape.",

KnowledgeCompass might have faced challenges from well-established global EdTech companies entering the Indian market or from domestic competitors leveraging foreign investment and technology. This could lead to intense price wars, pressure to constantly innovate, and the need to acquire advanced technology or talent to stay competitive. They would have had to invest heavily in marketing, product development, and customer acquisition strategies to carve out their niche and defend their market share against larger, more experienced players, potentially straining their initial resources.",

Over the decades, KnowledgeCompass expanded, leveraging new opportunities and navigating challenges posed by a globalising economy, eventually growing into a prominent corporation in the EdTech sector.

The government was unable to service its external debt. This crisis stemmed from inefficient management in the 1980s, characterized by excessive government expenditure on development programs and social sectors without corresponding revenue generation, leading to large fiscal deficits financed by borrowing. Income from public sector undertakings was insufficient, and foreign exchange borrowed was often spent on consumption needs. Exports did not grow sufficiently to match rising imports, further depleting reserves. The rising prices of essential goods compounded the crisis, compelling India to seek assistance from the World Bank and IMF, which imposed conditionalities for economic reforms.",
          "answer200Words": "The 1991 economic crisis in India was multi-faceted, rooted in inefficient economic management during the 1980s. A primary cause was the unsustainable fiscal deficit: government expenditure consistently outstripped revenue, leading to heavy domestic and international borrowing. Funds were disproportionately spent on social sectors and defense, which yielded no immediate returns, while revenue generation from taxation and public sector enterprises remained low. Crucially, foreign exchange reserves dwindled alarmingly, falling to levels that couldn't cover even two weeks of imports. This external debt crisis was exacerbated by a widening trade deficit—imports surged without matching export growth. Compounding these issues were rampant inflation and rising prices of essential goods, putting immense pressure on the populace. The inability to service foreign debt and the lack of foreign exchange forced India to approach international bodies like the World Bank and IMF, who mandated wide-ranging economic reforms as a condition for financial assistance, thereby changing the trajectory of India's developmental strategy.",

Financial sector reforms aimed to shift RBI's role from a regulator to a facilitator, allowing the entry of private and foreign banks and increasing foreign investment limits. Tax reforms included continuous reduction in individual and corporate income taxes, simplification of procedures, and later, the introduction of GST to create a common national market.

Firstly, the industrial sector saw a sweeping deregulation: industrial licensing was largely abolished for most products, and many industries previously reserved for the public sector were opened to private players. Market forces gained a greater role in price determination. Secondly, financial sector reforms redefined the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) role from a strict regulator to a facilitator, encouraging the entry of private and foreign banks and allowing Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to invest in Indian markets.

It was adopted as a reform measure to improve financial discipline, facilitate modernisation, and leverage private capital and managerial capabilities to enhance PSU performance. Disinvestment is a key method of privatisation, where the government sells off a part of the equity of PSEs to the public. This mobilises revenue, but critics argue it often undervalues assets and diverts funds from development. The 'Navratnas' policy, however, aimed to retain profitable PSEs in the public sector but grant them greater managerial and operational autonomy to enable them to compete globally and raise resources independently, rather than privatising them outright, thus fostering efficiency within the public domain.",

Disinvestment is a direct method of privatisation, involving the sale of a portion of the PSE's equity to the public. While the government aimed to improve financial health and modernise through disinvestment, critics often pointed to the undervaluation of public assets and the use of disinvestment proceeds to bridge revenue deficits rather than for PSU development or social infrastructure. In contrast, the 'Navratnas' policy introduced an alternative approach for profitable PSEs like Indian Oil and SAIL. Instead of outright privatisation, these enterprises were granted significant managerial, operational, and financial autonomy.

Furthermore, tax reductions, aimed at stimulating the economy, haven't significantly increased tax revenues, and limits on public expenditure have negatively impacted social sector development and welfare programs, raising concerns about the state's ability to address poverty and inequality effectively.",
          "answer200Words": "The 1991 economic reforms in India, while boosting overall GDP growth, have drawn significant criticism concerning their implications for social justice and welfare. Scholars argue that the reforms, influenced by externally advised policy packages, potentially exacerbated pre-existing deep-rooted inequalities in Indian society. The growth witnessed has been largely concentrated in high-growth, high-skill service sectors such as telecommunication, information technology, finance, entertainment, and real estate. This has disproportionately benefited high-income groups, leading to a widening of economic disparities among nations and within the country, as income and quality of consumption improved predominantly for this segment. In contrast, vital sectors like agriculture and traditional industries, which employ a vast majority of the population and are crucial for inclusive development, have either seen decelerating growth or faced adverse competition, impacting livelihoods. Furthermore, the reforms, including tax reductions and tariff liberalisation, have curtailed the government's ability to raise revenue, placing limits on public expenditure in critical social sectors like education and health. This reduced public investment in welfare programs raises concerns about the state's capacity to address poverty, unemployment, and ensure broad-based social justice, suggesting that market-driven globalisation may compromise the welfare and identity of the poor.",
